# Ceci nâ€™est pas une pi

This code was part of an artistic practice for my studies including an essay. It illustrates that the approximation of the number Pi through the Monte Carlo method gives an interesting perspective on the change from modernism to post-modernism. The program is written in the [Processing IDE](https://www.processing.org/).
